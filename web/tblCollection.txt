Probably not much widespread appeal."	2.4	"Probably the most thorough aural documentation of GMWA conferences and participants from 1992-1995, but given the wide temporal and geographic scope of these 71 cassettes, the amount of coverage of any one event is unlikely to be extremely thorough."	4	"There may be other recordings of the GMWA rehearsals and performances, but this is extremely difficult to ascertain.

They got stuck on a shelf and haven’t been copied yet, but contrary to our finding aid, they do exist, and I will make copies of them, and they should be put into the queue for digitization.  This project (#100) gets a 3.6 for subject interest (it discusses courtship, birth, and childrearing practices in villages of Russian and Tatar women), a 4.0 for content quality, a 4.8 for rareness, and a 4.0 for documentation (because there is a book called Village Mothers by David Ransel for which these interviews formed the basis).
